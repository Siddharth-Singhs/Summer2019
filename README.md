## Course:

## Log:

### Day 16:
#### Intern Work:
- Finally completed the multithreading part in webscraping script.

#### Interview Preparation:
--

### Day 15:
#### Intern Work:
- Completed two scraping script and connected the script to MySQL database.

### Day 14:(Sunday)
#### 
- Just watched the videos of Trees. 

### Day 13:(Saturday)
#### Hackathon:
- Working on the proposal for Hackathon.

### Day 12:
#### Intern Work:
- Still trying to figure out multithreading part script.Browser handling is quite difficult in multithreading of Scraping Script.

#### Extra Work(Previous Intern Work):
- Finalise the two major projects i.e Restaurant Rating Prediction using Zomato Dataset and Box office Collection prediction using movie dataset

#### Interview Preparation:
- No Progress Today.

### Day 11:
#### Intern Work
- Still working on multithreading problem in Scraping Script.Just few edges cases are left

#### Interview Preparation:
- No Progress Today

### Day 10:
#### Intern Work:
- Dealt with multithreading problem in scraping script.
- Still many edge cases are left to be solved.

#### Interview Preparation:
- Done problem related Recursion.

### Day 9:

#### Intern Work:
- Integrated the scraping script with the Machine learning model.
- The machine learning model saved quite lot of time in scraping.
- Worked on the multi-threading part to decrease the running time of script.

#### Interview Preparation:
- No progress today.

### Day 8:
#### Intern Work:
- Worked on new Scrapping Script using Selenium and Beautifulsoup.
- Collected data for training a new machine learning model.

#### Interview Preparation:
- Revised the topic Recursion.

### Day7:(Sunday)
#### Extra Work(Previous Intern Work):
- Some work was left from the previous intern.
- Created a major project on machine learning based on Pokemon Battles.
- In which we have a model to predict the outcome of Pokemon Battles.


#### Interview Preparation:
No Progress Today

### Day6:
#### Intern Work:
- Now in automation script JSON file can be also given as input.
- Worked on one more scrapping task just to check the model performance
- Now model accuracy has improved quite a lot to 87%.
- I think so just tuning the parameter the accuracy can be improved a lot.

#### Interview Preparation
No Progress Today.

### Day5:
#### Intern Work:
- Dealt with every edge conditions of automation scripts.
- Completed the work left for MySQL Database. Now every data from the scrapping is stored perfectly.
- Deploying the automation script on Amazon Web Service is left.
- No improvement in model accuracy.Thinking to try a new approach to solving that problem.

#### Interview Preparation
No Progress Today


### Day4:
#### Intern Work:
- Created the MySQL Database for storing the scraped data.
- Created the resumable feature in scrapping script so something due to network failure we don't have scrape again whole data.
- No Improvement in the model accuracy. I think we need to change the approach to solving this type of problem.
- Used Tesseract OCR for testing some images. But OCR was not able to detect the image.
- Some part of work is left in creating the database which we will be completed by tomorrow.

#### Interview Preparation
No Progress Today

### Day3:
#### Intern Work:
- Used Selenium to scrape the data from the website. (Can't share the website details due to Company privacy policy)
- Used pretrained machine learning model with the selenium.
- Tomorrow is the deadline for Scrapping the data. Scrapping part is completed just creating a database has been left for storing the scraped data.
- Tuned the configuration file of YoloV3 for increasing the accuracy of Captcha Detection.
- Model was able to detect 2 images correctly out of 201 images.
- Model achieve approx 1% of accuracy.

#### Interview Preparation
No Progress Today

For All who need to step in life they need to first wake up.

### Day2:
#### Intern Work:
- Still Working on YoloV3 model and its accuracy is less than 1%.
- The Previous error has been debugged.
- Now Model has started recognizing a few characters from the word.So there is chance of Improvement.
- New Task has been assigned for Scrapping the data from the website.

#### Interview Preparation:
No Progress Today



### Day1:
#### Intern Work:
- Working on YoloV3 for Captcha Detection.
- Initial Accuracy is coming less than 1%.
- After tuning some parameter some error has generated in the model.
- Instead of placing a bounding box on the character of captcha it is just destroying the images.
